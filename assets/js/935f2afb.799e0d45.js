When enabled and configured in your slicer, RatOS will only probe the print area and your configured probe location, potentially saving a lot of time on smaller prints on bigger printers. RatOS will keep the resolution of your mesh (probes per mm), so that you always get consistent mesh performance. Contrary to KAMP and PAM, RatOS doesn\'t move your prime location, instead it probes the prime location (constrained by min/max bedmesh settings) a single time and uses the difference between the probe result and your zoffset to dynamically apply a gcode offset only for the prime macro. This ensures no collision with prime blob and the toolhead on small meshes.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"configuration/advanced-stepper-configuration":{"id":"configuration/advanced-stepper-configuration","title":"Advanced Stepper Configuration","description":"RatOS V1.1 introduced modularized stepper and driver configuration, this can be used for more fine grained control of your steppers.
